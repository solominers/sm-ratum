//! A submitted share: its verdict, the receipt an anti-block-withholding slot gets, the block
//! relayed when the share is one, and the credit recorded to the ledger.
//!
//! No share is credited on a job whose block the node has not validated. The first share on a job
//! that carries transactions makes the pool request them (0x50 0x12), before any share on the job
//! can be known to be a block, and the shares on the job are held until they arrive; the node then
//! checks the job's block with each coinbase its shares use (`getblocktemplate` proposal mode,
//! every consensus rule but the proof of work). A gateway that withholds the transactions, or
//! builds a job the node refuses, has none of its shares on that job credited, and a block found
//! on a validated job is relayed from the transactions the pool already holds.
