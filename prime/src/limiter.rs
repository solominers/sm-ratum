//! The hashrate limiter: each identity (a payout address, one lottery ticket) may bring at most
//! a bounded hashrate, measured over several periods at once. A short period with a high
//! threshold catches a large miner within a minute, and a long period with a low threshold
//! holds the cap the pool is built around, while the variance of a small miner's share
//! arrivals over a short period never reaches the short period's threshold. An identity over
//! any bracket has its shares refused (`RejectReason::HashLimit`) while it stays over. Which
//! shares are refused depends on the gateway they come through: the identity's home gateway,
//! the one that has mined it the most over the last `HOME_DAYS`, keeps its shares accepted
//! unless its own shares alone are over, and every other gateway's are refused. A gateway
//! pointing hashrate at someone else's address to get it refused only gets itself refused.
//!
//! An identity whose home gateway's own shares read over a bracket is known to be over the
//! cap, and is banned for `--ban-secs`, longer each time when escalation is set. The longest
//! bracket is the cap itself, and `--hash-limit-sigma` widens it by the wobble of a reading
//! over few shares, so a rig just under the cap is never banned by the variance of its own
//! share arrivals; the shorter brackets stand well above the cap, where no honest rig reads,
//! and get no margin. The reading that bans counts the gateway's refused shares too, so a
//! rig that stays over is banned even while its shares are being refused, and it must rest
//! on at least `MIN_BAN_SHARES` shares, so a single share of a very high difficulty, which
//! reads as a huge rate over a short period, bans nobody: that is refused and nothing more.
//! Only the home gateway's own shares can ban: a stranger's burst at an address is refused.
//! The operators also ban by hand (`--ban`); bans are written to the ledger file, so a
//! restart keeps them.
//!
//! A share is placed at its header time, no earlier than `REPLAY_ALLOWANCE` before its
//! acceptance: a gateway that reconnects replays the shares it queued while it was away, and
//! those would read as a burst at their acceptance time, while a header time can be pushed
//! back only that far and by then the longer brackets have the measure.
