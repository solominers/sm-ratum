"""End-to-end runs of the whole stack on regtest.

  bitcoind (Knots, BLAKE2b branch) <- RPC - ratum-gateway - DATUM -> ratum-prime - RPC -> bitcoind
                                                  ^ sia-test-miner

The pool's own tests cover the pool. These runs cover what only the real programs can: that
the gateway accepts what the pool dictates, that a share the pool verifies is a block the
node accepts, and the accounting that appears only with several miners. The node itself
mines through the activation height first, as happened on mainnet; the stack serves only
version 2 work.

  e2e/e2e.py full-stack          the activation block through one gateway and one miner
  e2e/e2e.py multi-miner         three miners behind two gateways: credit and payout split
  e2e/e2e.py public-gateway-fee  a tagged gateway's shares charged, the fee paid to the
                                 other gateway's miner
  e2e/e2e.py finder-split        an operator fee, the finder's cut to the gateway that found
                                 the block, the window paid the rest
  e2e/e2e.py hash-limit          a miner over the hashrate limit banned, its shares refused,
                                 the ban listed, ended, and a setting changed over the
                                 control socket

Every run needs a Bitcoin Knots build with the BLAKE2b change, named by BITCOIND and
BITCOIN_CLI (default ~/src/bitcoin/build/bin/); the gateway is this workspace's
ratum-gateway crate, built here, unless DATUM_GATEWAY or --gateway names another build (the
C gateway, say). --keep leaves the work directory with every log. A run exits 0 only when
each of its checks passed.
